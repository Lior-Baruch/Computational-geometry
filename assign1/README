README

This repository contains a Python implementation of solutions for four computational geometry exercises.

Exercise 1.1:
The program sorts a given set of n integers utilizing a function that computes the convex hull of a set of points in the plane.

Exercise 1.2:

The program sorts a given set P of points into a counterclockwise circular order about an anchor point that is strictly inside the convex hull of P.
The program implements an algorithm that computes the convex hull of P in linear time.
Exercise 1.3:
The program devises an algorithm that computes the convex hull of k convex polygons P1, P2, ..., Pk in the plane (not necessarily disjoint) with overall n vertices, in time O(nlog(k)).

Exercise 1.4:

The program computes the convex hull of k convex polygons P1, P2, ..., Pk in the plane (not necessarily disjoint) with overall n vertices, in time O(kh+n), where h is the number of vertices of the convex hull C.
The program computes the convex hull C of a given set S of n points in the plane, assuming knowledge of the number h of the number of vertices of the convex hull of S, in time O(nlogh).
To run the programs, navigate to the root directory of the repository and run the respective Python files.

Dependencies:
The programs rely on the following Python libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, and CGAL.

Contributors:
The implementation was done by [Lior-Baruch].
