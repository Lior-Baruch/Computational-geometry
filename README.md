This repository contains solutions for three computational geometry assignments from the course taught by Efi Fogel in Fall 2023. Each assignment is contained in a separate subdirectory, with the following naming convention: assignX, where X is the assignment number.

Within each subdirectory, there are source files, documentation, and instructions for running the programs, as specified in the assignment instructions. The source files are written in either Python or C++, depending on the assignment.

Below is a brief summary of each assignment:

# Assignment 1:
This assignment contains solutions to four exercises, including sorting a set of points using the convex hull function, sorting points in a circular order, computing the convex hull of a set of points in linear time, and computing the convex hull of k convex polygons in O(nlog(k)) time.

# Assignment 2:
This assignment contains solutions to four exercises, including the gift wrapping algorithm in 3D space, properties of planar maps and graphs, an algorithm for orienting a polygon to minimize its height, and constructions of guard placements that do not fully cover a polygon.

# Assignment 3:
This assignment contains solutions to five exercises, including algorithms for finding a stabber for a set of closed segments, constructing the union of axis-parallel rectangles, computing an axis-parallel rectangle containing all vertices of an arrangement of lines, solving Hopcroft's problem, and proving bounds on the complexity of the union of polygonal pseudodisks.

To run the programs, navigate to the root directory of the respective assignment and follow the instructions in the provided documentation.

Dependencies:
The programs may rely on various libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, CGAL, and CMake, depending on the assignment.

Contributors:
The solutions were implemented by [Lior-Baruch].
